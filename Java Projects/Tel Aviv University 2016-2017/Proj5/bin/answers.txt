isPalindrome: 
not ok-
first of all no need to check if a is null cuz of @pre.
second- for palindrome : "abba", the method needs to return true because
the boolean statment in the "@post" is true. and the method returns false. wrong.

sum:
ok

average:
not ok:
cuz data my be new double[]{} with data.length == 0
and then we get naN and defintly not data[0] +... + data[data.length -1 == -1]

roots:
ok.
unnecceriy check of if a == 0
but rest is ok and method is accepting the contract.
